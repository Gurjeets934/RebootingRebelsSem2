# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have required tools installed on your OS, for running the application, especially Android Studio, because the application is tested in that only.. Thankyou!

## Step 1: Create Directory and Start Metro

First, you need to create the directory by downloading or pulling all the files, then just "cd Project Folder" and then run with the command "npx react-native start"... this will start the metro server.. 

## Step 2: Starting the app, via ios/Android

You need to either choose Android or iOS for running the project/application, but in our case it is "Android" that we built in the application for..

### For Android

After running metro, open "Android Studio" and open the "android" project in the "RebootingRebelsSem2" Folder and then launch the application after 'gradle sync'

### For iOS

After running metro, open "Xcode" and launch the application in your end.., but in our case, we have not initiliazed with iOS, so, you may need to do some configurations..

### Executing the Application

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see application running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### About the App

This application is our previous semester project for React-Native Course, and we have built the Firebase Integration Functionality according to the requirements..

There are few changes like, we are not using "Tabs", instead we are using "Navigation", but we are using services like "API" and "Helper" this time which is an addition..

Moreover, we have learnt the new concepts for "React-Native" and able to use in the developing environment, plus we have also learned how to integrate "Firebase" with it using right configuration.

Thankyou! We all team of four members who enjoy to code and helpful to the community by commiting :) :) :)
